### Project Description
Chayalytics is a playful mood and drama analyzer built around India‚Äôs favorite drink: tea. Users can choose the color of their last tea, submit anonymous ‚Äútea‚Äù (gossip), and the system assigns a mood, drama level (via Chaya Meter üî•), and predicts when they‚Äôll crave their next cup based on their last tea time. 


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are emotionally overwhelmed but don‚Äôt have a proper way to predict mood based on tea color,track their gossip intake or determine when they'll crave their next chaya fix. Society needs closure. And a kettle.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Built a sassy web app that:
Predicts your mood based on the shade of tea.
Lets users submit their tea (gossip) anonymously.
Assigns a random mood and drama level, turning gossip into data.
Offers a ‚ÄúChaya Meter‚Äù filter for spicy drama sorting.
Estimates your next craving based on time since last sip.
